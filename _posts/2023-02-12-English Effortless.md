## 2023/02/12 The Seven rule of Effortless english

###### 2023/02/09

###### 1. Stop studying English words. 

Native speakers do not learn 
English by remembering single words. Native speakers learn phrases. 
Phrases are GROUPS of words that naturally go together. 

* RULE 1: Always Study and Review Phrases, Not Individual Words
Never study a single, individual word. 


###### 2. Don't Study Grammar 

 Grammar rules teach you to think about English, you want to speak automatically-- without thinking! 

###### 3. The Most Important Rule-- Listen First

You must listen to UNDERSTANDABLE English. You must listen to English EVERYDAY. Don't read textbooks. Listen to English.

* Learn With Your Ears, Not Your Eyes
Spend most of your study time listening- that is the key to great speaking.

###### 4. Slow, Deep Learning Is Best

Hyun learned a lot of words in a short time. Her learning was short and shallow. That's why she quickly forgot the words. That's why she could
not use them.
The secret to speaking easily is to learn every word & phrase DEEPLY.

How do you learn deeply? 

Easy just repeat all lessons or listening many times. 

For example, if you have an audio book, listen to the `first chapter 30 times` before you go to the second chapter. 

You could listen to the `first chapter 3 times each day,for 10 days`.

###### 5. Use Point Of View Mini-Stories

I call these stories "Point Of View Mini-Stories". They are the most powerful way to learn and use English grammar automatically.

You must learn grammar by listening to real English. The best way is to listen to the same story... `told in different times (points of view)`

###### 6. You Must Learn Real English

Stop Learning Textbook English,To learn real English, you must listen to English that native speakers listen to. `You must watch what they watch. You must read what they` 

Use real magazines, audio articles, TV shows, movies, radio talk shows, and audio books.

###### 7. Listen and Answer, not Listen and Repeat

 I told her that `listen and repeat` is not enough when you repeat, you only copy the speaker. But when you hear a question and you ANSWER it you must think in English.

 How can you use Listen & Answer Stories? 
 
 Easy! Find a native speaker tutor. Ask him to use this method: Ask him to tell a story... and to constantly ask you easy questions about it. This will teach you to think quickly in English!
